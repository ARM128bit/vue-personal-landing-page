      I am a Front-end Developer with 9 years of experience building intuitive,

      I thrive in collaborative environments and am passionate about staying
      updated with the latest trends in front-end development. Whether it's
      building complex state management solutions with Redux or creating dynamic
      user interfaces with Vue.js, I always aim to deliver reliable and
      responsive applications.
